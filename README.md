# Minimal Weather App

A clean, minimal weather application built with Flutter. It automatically detects your location to display the current temperature and weather conditions, complete with beautiful Lottie animations and persistent theme support (Light/Dark/System).

## Features

* ‚òÄÔ∏è **Dynamic Weather:** Displays the current temperature and weather condition.
* üìç **Location-Based:** Automatically fetches weather data for your current location using the `geolocator` and `WeatherService`.
* üèôÔ∏è **City Name Display:** Uses `geocoding` to convert latitude/longitude into a user-friendly city name.
* üé® **Theme Support:** Includes beautifully crafted Light and Dark themes.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **System Theme:** Automatically adapts to the user's system theme preference.
* üíæ **Persistent Theme:** Saves the user's theme choice (Light, Dark, or System) locally using `shared_preferences`.
* üì± **Responsive UI:** Adapts to different screen sizes using `flutter_screenutil`.
* ‚ú® **Animations:**
    * An animated splash screen with fade and scale transitions.
    * Dynamic Lottie animations that change based on the weather condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).

## How It Works

1.  **`main.dart`**: Initializes the app, loads the saved theme using `ThemeProvider`, and sets up `ScreenUtilInit` for responsiveness. `ChangeNotifierProvider` is used to manage the app's theme state.
2.  **`SplashScreen.dart`**: A stateful widget that displays an animated logo for 6 seconds before navigating to the main `WeatherPage`.
3.  **`WeatherPage.dart`**:
    * Fetches the user's current GPS coordinates.
    * Calls `WeatherService` to get weather data from an API (using the provided `apiKey`).
    * Uses `geocoding` to find a displayable city name from the coordinates.
    * Displays the city name, temperature, and a `Lottie` animation relevant to the `mainCondition` (e.g., 'Clouds', 'Rain', 'Clear').
    * Includes an `AppBar` icon to navigate to the `SettingsPage`.
4.  **`SettingsPage.dart`**:
    * Allows the user to select a theme: Light, Dark, or System.
    * Uses `Provider.of<ThemeProvider>(context)` to listen for and update the theme.
    * The UI consists of animated, tappable containers for each theme option.
5.  **`ThemeProvider.dart`**:
    * A `ChangeNotifier` class that manages the `ThemeOption` (light, dark, system).
    * Uses `SharedPreferences` to `saveTheme()` and `loadTheme()` so the user's choice is remembered after the app closes.
6.  **`theme.dart`**: Defines the `ThemeData` for `lightMode` and `darkMode`.

## Key Packages Used

* **State Management:** `provider`
* **UI Responsiveness:** `flutter_screenutil`
* **Animations:** `lottie`
* **Location:** `geolocator` & `geocoding`
* **Local Storage:** `shared_preferences`
* **API Calls:** `http` (implied, for `WeatherService`)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Eslam-code-gif/minimal_weather_app.git](https://github.com/Eslam-code-gif/minimal_weather_app.git)
    cd minimal_weather_app
    ```

2.  **Get dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Add Your API Key:**
    This project requires a weather API key (e.g., from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)).
    You must add your key to the `AppStrings` file (likely in `lib/const/strings.dart`).

    ```dart
    // lib/const/strings.dart
    class AppStrings {
      static const String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
      // ... other strings
    }
    ```

4.  **Configure Location Permissions:**
    Ensure you have added the necessary location permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` (for Android) and `Info.plist` (for iOS).

5.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
